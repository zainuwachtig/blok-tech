# Airies

Airies is a matching application, like tinder but then for air max. I made this application as a school project for the 3rd quarter in the second year, more information about the courses can be found on [this Github page](https://github.com/cmda-bt). The whole process is documented (in Dutch) in the [wiki](https://github.com/zainuwachtig/blok-tech/wiki).

## Concept

With Airies you can fill in the air max models you like, based on your preferences you will get a selection of shoes which you can like (ðŸ”¥) or dislike (ðŸ—‘). You can find an image, the name, the stylecode and the year of the shoe on the cards. You can also superlike your favourites, they get a yellow / golden border, so you can easily find them in the list of liked shoes!

I used [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/) as database for my application. In the database is a collection for the users and their liked / dislikes shoes and also a collection for the shoes in the application.
